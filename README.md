As a very enthiousiastic user of Spotify I have a list called "Favorites", which I have been using since 2014. I listen to this playlist daily and add new songs to it when finding songs that I like, this will be an important factor for later. As I always want to find new tunes, every week I listen to my Discover Weekly playlist that spotify so kindly makes for me. Based on some research (for instance this article: https://qz.com/571007/the-magic-that-makes-spotifys-discover-weekly-playlists-so-damn-good/) I have a general idea of how spotify creates this Discover Weekly playlist and picks songs specifically for you. Two big factors that influence the songs that it will pick for you are when you ad new songs to a playlist and if you listen to songs a lot. Meaning that if I start adding/saving only techno songs from now on and only listen to techno songs, my discover weekly will probably provide me with more techno songs.

As my Discover Weekly playlists are based on songs I save and play often, I therefore could reason that the songs chosen for my Discover Weekly playlist are based mostly on tunes from my "Favorites" playlist, as I've been mainly using that over the past few years. And if I would start listening to for instance **ONLY** my boyfriends "Favorites" playlist, my discover weekly would change. Meaning that it will provide me with more songs that are based on his music taste. I should be able to see my discover weekly change over time.

To test this idea I will first give you a summary of some interesting features of my "Favorites" playlist. I will compare this to a summary of features of my discover weekly playlist, to see if they are sort of the same. If they are not totally the same, this is not a weird thing, as the Discover Weekly playlist is also based on more recent listening behavior and my "Favorites" playlist has been going on since 2014, see article. Then I will give a summary of some features of my boyfriends playlist. We will compare the three and look at the differences. The next step would be that for the coming 8 weeks, I will listen only to my boyfriends playlist and see if my Discover Weekly playlist will change over time and will start looking more like my boyfriends playlist. I will automitaclly save my Discover Weekly's in a playlist, as there actually is a setting for that, if you're interested: https://ifttt.com/applets/313481p-save-your-discover-weekly-tracks-to-a-playlist.

You don't have to worry about the fact that I could also listen to my discover weekly, as the discover weekly algorithm does not take listening behavior of the discover weekly songs itself into account when calculating what new songs to give you for you Discover Weekly.
